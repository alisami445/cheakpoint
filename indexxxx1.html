      <p>
        Gaming is bigger than ever. The games industry is now larger than both
        cinema and music, and with the advent of mobile gaming, more people are
        playing games than ever before. However, the appeal of gaming is still a
        mystery for many people. Some of you will have played games when they
        were younger, but let the hobby fall by the wayside. Some of you will
        have never picked up a game in your life. So what’s the fuss about? What
        does the landscape of gaming looks like in 2017 and why are so many
        people playing them?

              According to GameTrack (Q4 2016) 18 million people in the UK play
              games – this equates to around 38% of everyone in the 6-64 age
              bracket. Gamers are often imagined as adolescent males, but
              statistics show that this demographic (males ages 15-24) make up
              just 16% of the overall audience. In fact, 43% of UK gamers are
              female and audience is split fairly evenly across age groups. This
              diversification in audience is partially due to the rise of mobile
              gaming. Whereas games used to be tied to bespoke hardware, they
              are now easily accessible through mobile devices and tablets. This
              has opened games up to a larger variety of people, and has secured
              its own place in the market with big-hitters such as Candy Crush
              Saga and Pokémon GO. Interestingly, not everyone that plays games
              on mobile would consider themselves to be “gamers”. In fact, this
              shift has created a divide between “casual (mobile) gamers” and
              self-proclaimed “real gamers” who play on PC and consoles.
              Although audiences are diversifying, the games industry is
              dominated by male developers and often caters to a presumed
              heterosexual male audience. Unfortunately this often leads to
              over-sexualised female characters and a distinct lack of non-male,
              non-white characters to play as. These issues were called into
              question with 2014’s “Gamergate” controversy and thankfully many
              games developers have since made efforts to provide more diverse
              experiences and options for their audiences

        <span>Games consoles</span> are dedicated machines intended for home
        use. If you’ve ever played an <span>atari</span> ,<span
          >Sega Megadrive</span
        >
        , Nintendo 64 or SNES then that’s the kind of machine we’re talking
        about. The biggest players in the console market are Sony, Microsoft and
        Nintendo – whose current models are Playstation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo
        Switch (respectively). Additionally you have Nintendo’s 3DS and Sony’s
        Playstation Vita, which are commonly referred to as
        <i>“handhelds”</i> and are essentially miniature games consoles designed
        to be played on the go.
